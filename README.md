Hello! 

I'm Bridget, a student at UC San Diego and programming enthuthiast! I have a lot of interests, but my favorite projects are those that lie in the realm of Computational Linguistics. I enjoy programming in Python, Java, Clojure, Javascript, and more :) 

Please feel free to reach out to me at began@ucsd.edu! Thanks!
