Hello! 

I'm Bridget, a law student at UC Law SF. 

I attended UC San Diego and became a programming enthuthiast, and later went to law school! I have a lot of interests, but my favorite projects are those that lie in the realm of Computational Linguistics and data security. I enjoy programming in Python, Java, Clojure, Javascript, and more :) 

Please feel free to reach out to me.  Thanks!
